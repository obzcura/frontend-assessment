Bonus point
---
Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.<br />
- " + + 'a' " this is part of the the code that makes it "banana". The first "+" means concatenate and because of the space, the next "+" means add but "a" is not an integer so the result is "NaN"<br />
- I'll be honest, I've researched the answer for this question.
